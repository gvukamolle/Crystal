# Crystal

**Claude directly in Obsidian.** Claude Code CLI integration for working with notes — full power of Claude without web interface limitations.

---

## What is this?

Crystal is an Obsidian plugin that integrates Claude Code CLI directly into your note vault:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) — powerful analysis, reasoning, extended thinking for complex tasks

Not just a chatbot, but a full-featured agent with access to your vault. It **sees your notes**, can **edit them**, **search the web**, and work within the context of your knowledge base.

### Why is this cool?

- **Direct work with notes** — mention files via `@`, the agent sees their content and can edit them
- **Fine-tuned agent** — permissions, models, Extended Thinking, personalization
- **Skills system** — 6 built-in skills for Obsidian + custom skill support
- **Usage statistics** — token tracking, visual limits, daily history
- **One-click editing** — AI responses can be instantly inserted into notes (replace, append, copy)
- **Web search and analysis** — Claude can search and read web pages (configurable permissions)
- **Extended Thinking** — deep analysis for complex tasks
- **8 interface languages** — Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese
- **Slash commands** — quick actions: `/summarize`, `/translate`, `/rewrite` and more + custom commands
- **Model selection** — Claude Haiku/Sonnet/Opus 4.5
